# ZupEat - A food site platform 

# About the Project

ZupEat is a clean and modern food-ordering web app inspired by Zomato/Swiggy.
Users can browse dishes from different restaurants, apply menu filters, and explore items easily through a smooth and responsive UI.

I focused on writing clean, readable, and reusable code, so anyone checking this repo can quickly understand how each UI section is structured and handled.

# What I Built & Learned

This was my first time working deeply with TypeScript, and honestly, it felt tough in the beginning — but once I understood the flow, I actually enjoyed building the whole project with it.
It helped me organize my components better and write more reliable frontend logic.
